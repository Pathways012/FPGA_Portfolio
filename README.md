# FPGA_Portfolio
This repository is meant to document my progression in FPGA development using Xilinx Artix-7 (Basys 3) and Vivado, with a focus on RTL design, verification, timing-aware implementation, and defense-relevant applications.  Projects progress from foundational HDL concepts to signal processing and secure communications.
