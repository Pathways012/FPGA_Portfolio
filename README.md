# FPGA Development Portfolio (Basys 3 / Vivado)

## Overview
I am an FPGA developer focused on VHDL/Verilog, DSP, and secure hardware design.
Building a public FPGA portfolio with projects ranging from basic RTL designs to
defense-relevant applications such as encrypted communications and radar signal processing.
Actively preparing for aerospace/defense FPGA roles and clearance-sponsored opportunities.

This repository documents my progression in FPGA development using
Xilinx Artix-7 (Basys 3) and Vivado, with a focus on RTL design,
verification, timing-aware implementation, and defense-relevant applications.

The goal is to document projects progressing from foundational HDL concepts to
signal processing and secure communications.

## Technical Focus Areas
- RTL design in VHDL and Verilog
- Synchronous digital design and FSMs
- Vivado simulation, synthesis, and implementation
- XDC constraints and timing analysis
- FPGA-based DSP and cryptography

## Hardware & Tools
- FPGA Board: Digilent Basys 3 (Xilinx Artix-7)
- Toolchain: Xilinx Vivado
- Simulation: Vivado Simulator
- Languages: VHDL, Verilog

## Project Structure
- `beginner/` – Foundational RTL and timing concepts
- `intermediate/` – Interfaces, datapaths, and control logic
- `advanced/` – BRAM, DSP pipelines, system-style designs
- `security-defense/` – Cryptography and radar-style processing

## Career Alignment
This portfolio is intentionally structured to reflect workflows
used in aerospace, defense, and secure embedded systems,
with emphasis on determinism, verification, and documentation.
