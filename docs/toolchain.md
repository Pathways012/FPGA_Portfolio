## Toolchain Selection

Initial FPGA work was performed using smaller devices,
but development transitioned to Xilinx Artix-7 and Vivado
to align with industry-standard defense and aerospace workflows.

Vivado provides:
- Accurate timing analysis
- IP integration
- XDC-based constraints
- Scalable design practices
